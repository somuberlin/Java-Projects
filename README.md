1. Tic Tac Toe (Java Console Game)

   📌 Overview

      This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java for two human players in the console.
   Players take turns placing their marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

   The project demonstrates:
   
        a) 2D arrays in Java
        b) Object-Oriented Programming concepts
        c) User input handling via Scanner
        d) Basic game loop and win-condition logic

    🎮 How to Play
   
        1) Run the program in a Java-supported environment.
        2) Enter player names when prompted.
        3) Players take turns entering their move:
              a) Input format: row column (e.g., 1 2 means row 1, column 2).
              b) Rows and columns are indexed from 0 to 2.
        4) The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
        5) The game ends immediately when a win is detected.

2. Ticket Raising System 🎫 (Java Console Application)
  
   📌 Overview
   
      A simple Ticket Raising System built in Java to create, view, and update tickets.
   This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, classes, objects, encapsulation, and collections.

      🚀 Features

            a) Raise a Ticket → Create new tickets with title and description.
            b) View All Tickets → Display a list of all raised tickets.
            c) Update Ticket Status → Change the status of a ticket (Open, In Progress, or Closed).
            d) Exit → Exit the system gracefully.

      🛠️ Tech Stack

         Language: Java
         Data Structure: ArrayList (for storing tickets)
         Concepts Used: Encapsulation, Object-Oriented Programming, Loops, and Switch Case
