📌 Overview
    This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java for two human players in the console.
Players take turns placing their marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

The project demonstrates:

a) 2D arrays in Java

b) Object-Oriented Programming concepts

c) User input handling via Scanner

🎮 How to Play
1) Run the program in a Java-supported environment.

2) Enter player names when prompted.

3) Players take turns entering their move:

  a) Input format: row column (e.g., 1 2 means row 1, column 2).

  b) Rows and columns are indexed from 0 to 2.

4) The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

5) The game ends immediately when a win is detected.
