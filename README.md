1. Tic Tac Toe (Java Console Game)

   ðŸ“Œ Overview
        This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java for two human players in the console.
    Players take turns placing their marks ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

    The project demonstrates:
   
        a) 2D arrays in Java
        b) Object-Oriented Programming concepts
        c) User input handling via Scanner
        d) Basic game loop and win-condition logic

    ðŸŽ® How to Play
        1) Run the program in a Java-supported environment.
        2) Enter player names when prompted.
        3) Players take turns entering their move:
              a) Input format: row column (e.g., 1 2 means row 1, column 2).
              b) Rows and columns are indexed from 0 to 2.
        4) The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
        5) The game ends immediately when a win is detected.
